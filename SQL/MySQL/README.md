## What is MySQL?

- **MySQL** is one of the most popular **open-source relational database management systems (RDBMS)**.
- It uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** for managing databases.
- MySQL is known for being **fast, reliable, and scalable**, making it widely used in web applications, especially for **data storage** and **retrieval**.

### Key Concepts:
- **Database**: A structured collection of data.
- **Table**: A related data collection organized in rows and columns.
- **SQL Queries**: Commands used to interact with the database (e.g., retrieving data, inserting data).
- **MySQL Server**: The software that manages the databases and handles queries from clients (like your Python application).
